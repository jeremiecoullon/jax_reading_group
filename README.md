# Jax reading group

The objective of the reading group is to learn about JAX. For each session we chose a few features of JAX to learn and use them to write an algorithm.


## Past sessions

1. `grad`, `vmap`, and `jit`: gradient descent for logistic regression (15th October 2020)

2. Design of the JAX random number generator and stochastic gradient descent.

## Future session

*12th November 2020:*
- TBA but probably how autodiff works and `jax` implementation.
