# Jax reading group

The objective of the reading group is to learn about Jax. For each session we chose a few features of Jax to learn and use them to write an algorithm.


## Past sessions

1. `grad`, `vmap`, and `jit`: gradient descent for logistic regression (15th October 2020)


## Future session

*19th October 2020:*
- Creating random numbers with Jax and reading the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) [design notes](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/master/design_notes/prng.md)
- Application: stochastic gradient descent for logistic regression
