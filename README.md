# Jax reading group

The objective of the reading group is to learn about JAX. For each session we chose a few features of JAX to learn about.


## Past sessions

1. `grad`, `vmap`, and `jit`: gradient descent for logistic regression (15th October 2020)

2. Design of the JAX random number generator and stochastic gradient descent.

3. Automatic differentiation

4. The [Jaxpr](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jaxpr.html): what it is and how to use it

## Future session

*10th December 2020:*
- TBC but maybe [loops/scan/while](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#Structured-control-flow-primitives)
